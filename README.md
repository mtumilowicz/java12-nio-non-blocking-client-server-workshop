# introduction
* current JVMs run bytecode at speeds approaching that of natively compiled code or even better (dynamic 
runtime optimizations), so
    * applications are no longer CPU bound (spending most of their time executing code) 
    * they are I/O bound (waiting for data transfers)
* how to adjust number of threads
    * CPU intense tasks - adding more threads than cores will have harmful effect on performance,
    suppose that processor works at full power and we force it to do context switches
    * I/O waiting - adding more threads could be beneficial - context switches are not so harmful
    if thread is only waiting
    * `Nthreads = NCPU * UCPU * (1 + W/C)`
        * NCPU is the number of cores, available through 
        `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`
        * UCPU is the target CPU utilization (between 0 and 1)
        * W/C is the ratio of wait time to compute time
* operating system vs Java stream-based I/O model
    * operating system wants to move data in large chunks (buffers)
    * I/O classes of the JVM operates on small pieces â€” single bytes, or lines of text
    * operating system delivers buffers full of data -> stream classes of `java.io` breaks it down into little pieces
    * NIO provides similar concepts to operating system buffers - `ByteBuffer` object
    * `RandomAccessFile` with array-based `read( )` and `write( )` are pretty close to the underlying 
    operating-system calls (although at least one buffer copy)

# Buffer Handling
* buffers, and how buffers are handled, are the basis of all I/O
* "input/output" means nothing more than moving data in and out of buffers
* processes perform I/O by requesting operating system to:
    * write: drain data from a buffer 
    * read: fill buffer with data
* steps:
    1. process requests that its buffer be filled by making the `read()` system call
    1. kernel issuing a command to the disk controller hardware to fetch the data from disk
    1. disk controller writes the data directly into a kernel memory buffer by DMA (direct memory access)
    1. kernel copies the data from the temporary buffer to the buffer specified by the process
* kernel space is where the operating system lives
    * communication with device controllers
    * all I/O flows through kernel space
* why disk controller not send directly to the buffer in user space?
    * user space (where process lives) is a nonprivileged area: code executing there cannot directly access 
    hardware devices
    * block-oriented hardware devices such as disk controllers operate on fixed-size data blocks 
    * user process may be requesting an oddly sized chunk of data 
    * kernel plays the role of intermediary, breaking down and reassembling data as it moves between 
    user space and storage devices
* virtual memory means that artificial, or virtual, addresses are used in place of physical 
(hardware RAM) memory addresses (simulates RAM)
    * more than one virtual address can refer to the same physical memory location
    * virtual memory space can be larger than the actual hardware memory available
    * eliminates copies between kernel and user space by mapping a kernel space address to the same 
    physical address as a virtual address in user space, the DMA hardware (which can access only physical 
    memory addresses) can fill a buffer that is simultaneously visible to both the kernel and a user space process

## NIO
# Channels
* is a conduit to an I/O service (a hardware device, a file or socket) and provides methods for 
interacting with that service
* socket channel objects are bidirectional
* partial transfer - until buffer's `hasRemaining( )` method returns false
* cannot be reused - represents a specific connection to a specific I/O service and encapsulates 
the state of that connection 
* when a channel is closed - connection is lost

# Socket Channels
* models network sockets
* can operate in nonblocking mode and are selectable
* it's no longer necessary to dedicate a thread to each socket connection 
* it's possible to perform readiness selection of socket channels using a `Selector` object
* `SocketChannel`, `ServerSocketChannel` create a peer socket object when they are instantiated
    * classes from `java.net`: `Socket`, `ServerSocket` have been updated to be aware of channels
* Socket channels delegate protocol operations to the peer socket object
    * `ServerSocketChannel` doesn't have a `bind()` method, we have to fetch the peer
      socket and use it to bind to a port to begin listening for connections
* readiness selection - channel can be queried to determine if it's ready to perform an operation of interest, 
such as reading or writing
* sockets are stream-oriented, not packet-oriented
    * bytes sent will arrive in the same order, but
    * sender may write 20 bytes to a socket, and the receiver gets only 3 when invoking `read()` 
    - remaining part may still be in transit
    
# SelectionKey
* a key represents the registration of a particular channel object with a
  particular selector object - for example we have methods: `channel()`, `selector()`
* `SelectionKey` object contains two sets
    * the interest set - operations we are interested in
    * the ready set - operations the channel is ready to perform (time the selector last checked the states 
    of the registered channels)
* operations:
    * `isReadable()`,
    * `isWritable()`, 
    * `isConnectable()`,
    * `isAcceptable()`
* we should use one selector for all selectable channels and delegate the servicing of ready channels to other threads
  * therefore we have a single point to monitor channel readiness and a decoupled pool of worker threads to handle 
  the incoming data
      
# Selectors
* provide the ability to do readiness selection, which enables multiplexed I/O
    * I/O multiplexing is the capability to tell the kernel that we want to be notified if one or more I/O conditions 
    are ready, like input is ready to be read
* provide the capability to ask a channel if it's ready to perform an I/O operation of interest to you
  * for example - check if `ServerSocketChannel` has any incoming connections ready to accept
* manages information about a set of registered channels and their readiness states
* channels are registered with selectors, and a selector can be asked to update the readiness states of the 
  channels currently registered with it
* simple analogy
    * each pneumatic tube (channel) is connected to a single teller station inside the bank
    * station has three slots where the carriers (data buffers) arrive, each with an indicator (selection key) that 
    lights up when the carrier is in the slot
    * teller (worker thread) once for a couple of minutes glances up at the indicator lights (invokes select( )) 
    to determine if any of the channels are ready (readiness selection) 
    * teller (worker thread) can perform another task while the drive-through lanes (channels) are idle yet 
    still respond to them in a timely manner when they require attention
* invoking `select()` on a selector object causes that the associated keys are updated by checking all the channels 
registered with that selector
* by iterating over these keys, we can service each channel that has become ready since the last time we invoked 
`select()`
* large number of channels can be checked for readiness simultaneously
    * true readiness selection is performed by operating system
    * One of the most important functions performed by an operating system is to handle 
    I/O requests and notify processes when their data is ready 
    * abstractions by which Java code can request readiness selection service from the 
    underlying operating system
* given channel can be registered with more than one selector and has no idea which
  `Selector` objects it's currently registered with.
* data never passes through them
* maintains three sets of keys:
    * Registered key set
        * currently registered keys associated with the selector
        * not every registered key is necessarily still valid
        * returned by the `keys()` method 
    * Selected key set
        * `Selected key set c Registered key set`
        * key whose associated channel was determined by the selector to be ready for at least one of the 
        operations in the key's interest set
        * returned by the `selectedKeys()`
    * selected key set vs the key's ready set 
        * each key has an embedded ready set, and each key can be in selected key set
    * Cancelled key set
        * `Cancelled key set c Registered key set`
        * contains keys whose `cancel()` methods have been called (the key has been invalidated), 
        but they have not been deregistered     
* following three steps are performed:
  1. The cancelled key set is checked
    * each key in the cancelled set is removed from all three sets
    * the channel associated with the cancelled key is deregistered
  2. The operation interest sets of each key in the registered key set are examined.
    * the underlying operating system is queried to determine the actual readiness state 
    of each channel for its operations of interest. 
    * if the key for the channel is not already in the selected key set bits representing 
    the operations determined to be currently ready on the channel are set
  3. Step 1 are repeated to complete deregistration of any
  channels whose keys were cancelled while the selection operation was in progress.
* selector.select( );
  This call blocks indefinitely if no channels are ready. As soon as at least one of the registered
  channels is ready, the selection key set of the selector is updated, and the ready sets for each
  ready channel will be updated. The return value will be the number of channels determined to
  be ready. Normally, this method returns a nonzero value since it blocks until a channel is
  ready. But it can return 0 if the wakeup( ) method of the selector is invoked by another thread.
  * `select()` - The return value is not a count of ready channels, but the number of channels
      that became ready since the last invocation of select( ).
* wakeup( ), provides the capability to gracefully break out a thread from a blocked select( ) invocation
